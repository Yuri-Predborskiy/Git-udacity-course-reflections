What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, it creates initial branch of git history.
Meaning, no files are tracked, no commits are saved. It just greates a git repository.
I need to do that to create files/folders for git to be able to track history of changes later.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where I list files to be added to the next repository version.
It only lists files to be tracked inside the working directory, but does not contain files themselves.
It allows me to pick the files I want to track history of, ignoring other files.
It also writes useful info in git status command
