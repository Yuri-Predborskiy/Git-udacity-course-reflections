When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I work from more than one computer.
And when I want to share my work (code) with other people, allow them to download it, make changes, commit it and push to my repository.
For example, when I work together with other people in a company.
Or when I work from home PC and from work PC at the same time and want to sync changes.
Its also possible to use GitHub as a backup for my private projects (but, sadly, that feature is not free, comes with monthly subscription).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may want to commit my changes into a branch before pulling changes from remote depository rather than having Git stay up-to-date automatically.
I may also want to work on my local version and make changes and push them before pulling other branches from the remote.
Or I may end up in conflict when Git auto-syncs my local and remote versions of files, so I'll get stuck and won't be able to work till I fix merge conflicts.
In short, its typically more "safe" to push/pull when I feel ready rather than automatically. Same as committing.
