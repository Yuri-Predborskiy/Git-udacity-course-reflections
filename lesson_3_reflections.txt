When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I work from more than one computer.
And when I want to share my work (code) with other people, allow them to download it, make changes, commit it and push to my repository.
For example, when I work together with other people in a company.
Or when I work from home PC and from work PC at the same time and want to sync changes.
Its also possible to use GitHub as a backup for my private projects (but, sadly, that feature is not free, comes with monthly subscription).
